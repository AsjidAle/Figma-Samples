# Figma Designs Samples Repository

Welcome to my Figma Designs repository! This repository contains a collection of design files created using Figma. I will be uploading a new design every day, showcasing different UI/UX components, pages, and layouts. Each design will be shared with the intention of implementing its corresponding code in the future.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


Each day, I will upload the design file in the `/designs` folder, and later, I will implement the frontend code for each design.

## Future Plans

Once the designs are completed and uploaded, I will begin the process of converting them into working frontend code using technologies like React, HTML, and CSS (Bootstrap plus Tailwind CSS), NextJs, Remix, Angular, Vue.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step plan:
1. **Design Phase**: Upload a new design daily.
2. **Development Phase**: After completing a few designs, I will start coding each design to create fully functional pages.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this repository by providing feedback on the designs, suggesting improvements, or even submitting PRs with code implementations (once the coding phase begins).

## How to Use the Designs

You can view and inspect the Figma designs directly through Figma. If you'd like to build upon any of these designs, feel free to download them and use them for your own projects. 

To view and interact with the designs:
1. Open the Figma link associated with each design.
2. Explore the design and interact with its components.

## License

This repository is not licensed for commercial use without permission. Feel free to use these designs for personal projects or educational purposes.

Thank you for visiting my repository! Stay tuned for daily design updates and future code implementations!
